        <div class="caption-preview">Your eyes feel like a qui..</div>
        <div class="comment-box">
          Your eyes feel like a quiet recreation of a black hole—<br>
          deep and powerful—<br>
          carrying the elegance of a peacock feather,<br>
          impossible to look away from.<br><br>

          They carry stories of a wish to be loved,
          stories you never say out loud,
          yet somehow I understand them completely.<br><br>

          Your eyes don’t seek attention;
          they own it without asking.<br><br>

          When you look at me with those eyes,
          I feel fully seen—never judged.<br><br>

          When you smile with your eyes,
          everything inside me feels lighter.<br><br>

          There is a depth in your gaze
          that pulls me closer every time,
          and I find myself wanting to drown
          again and again in the world that lives inside your eyes.

        <div class="caption-preview">Your cupid-bow lips—my favo..</div>
        <div class="comment-box">
          Your cupid-bow lips—my favorite—<br>
          carry a smile that feels completely natural, never forced.<br><br>

          When you smile, the whole atmosphere changes,
          turning into something calm, satisfying, and deeply relaxing.<br><br>

          There’s a warmth in your smile
          that quietly melts my heart without asking permission.<br><br>

          Your smile turns my ordinary moments into memories
          worth holding onto.<br><br>

          Every tension I carry seems to leave
          the moment I see you smile.<br><br>

          When you smile, the world feels less complicated—
          everything suddenly feels easier.<br><br>

          The softness of your smile
          is like medicine to me,
          healing without words.

        <div class="caption-preview">Your hair flows like a blac..</div>
        <div class="comment-box">
          Your hair flows like a black river,<br>
          choosing its own natural path,<br>
          free and unforced.<br><br>

          It frames your face as if it has always belonged there,
          perfectly, without effort.<br><br>

          Your hair never looks arranged;
          it always looks aesthetic—<br>
          honest in its chaos, beautiful in its freedom.<br><br>

          When it catches the light,
          it feels like a horizon of freedom itself,
          quietly shining,
          limitless and alive.

        <div class="comment-box">
          Your cute little hands—<br>
          I can feel their softness even without touching them.<br><br>

          The way you hold things so gently
          makes my heart long for that same care.<br><br>

          There’s a warmth in your hands
          that I imagine resting on my face,
          quiet, comforting, unhurried.<br><br>

          And the presence of your hands—
          I want to feel it in mine,
          walking side by side,
          holding hands as if time itself doesn’t matter.

        <div class="comment-box">
          Your figure is magnetic—<br>
          it quietly pulls my desire to look at you,<br>
          to want you closer,<br>
          to touch every part of you.<br><br>

          The way you stand feels casual,
          yet completely impossible to ignore.<br><br>

          The curve of your waist is undeniably sexy,
          carrying a confidence that knows exactly
          what it does to my mind.<br><br>

          Your movements follow your own rhythm,
          natural, unforced, and deeply captivating.<br><br>

          Your figure doesn’t ask to be noticed;
          it simply commands my heart
          to bow before you.

          Your voice feels like nature whispering…
        </div>
        <div class="comment-box">
          Your voice feels like nature whispering instead of speaking.
          It arrives gently, like a breeze that doesn’t want to disturb anything.<br><br>

          When you sing, even the wind feels quieter,
          as if it’s listening to you.<br><br>

          Your voice flows like the sea at dawn—
          calm, steady, and full of quiet depth.<br><br>

          There’s a warmth in your voice
          that settles into me slowly,
          like waves touching the shore without urgency.<br><br>

          I don’t just hear your voice;
          I feel comforted by it,
          as if it knows exactly where to rest inside me.
